            Developers will be introduced to new concepts with presentations and also <strong>live examples</strong>. With live coding we can enhance interactions between trainees and instructors and provide <strong>tailor-made examples</strong> to traineesâ€™ queries.

          <p>
            By working in pairs developers have to explain to their partners what they do and how, rather than just doing it. Explaining is a great way to learn and to make sure concepts are clear. Pair programming also increases <strong>motivation and productivity</strong>.

          <p>
            Our experienced instructors will give developers <strong>individual feedback</strong> whilst developers are coding. Instructors will guide and mentor them to think of the best way to solve a given problem. Groups of 10 developers for 1 instructor on average.

          <p>
            We are strong believers in <strong>learning by doing</strong>, and so we want developers to code as much as possible, so they can make mistakes in a safe environment. You will have time to practise everything we explain during the training.
