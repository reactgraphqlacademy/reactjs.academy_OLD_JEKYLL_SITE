        <h2>
          <a name="1"></a>What information of mine is being collected?
        </h2>
        <p>
          As a base level of information, we might collect your email address.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <a name="2"></a>Who is collecting my information?
        </h2>
        <p>
          ReactJS.academy is collecting your email through a sign-up form.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <a name="3"></a>How are my details collected?
        </h2>
          As mentioned above, your email address will be collected through a sign-up form.
        <h2>
          <a name="4"></a>Why is it collected?
        </h2>
        In the first instance, your email address is used to send you newsletters about ReactJS.academy news.
        <h2>
          <a name="5"></a>How is my information used?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Using your email as the primary way of setting up the account means that, whatever happens - issues with your account, important notifications about our service etc - we have a means of contacting you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another key reason for collecting your email is to confirm your attendance at one of the trainings you have shown interest in attending. These communications will not be unsolicited and only initiated if you have indicated you’d like to receive them. These communications could be, but not excluded to, the following:
          Confirmation of event/training ticket purchase
          Reminder of upcoming events/training
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, if you have opted-in to the email newsletter, you will receive emails of a marketing nature that will feature events/trainings/services that you may not have indicated to us that you are interested in but we feel will enrich your experience with us. You are able to unsubscribe to these marketing emails by contactin us at <a href="mailto:hello@reactjs.academy">hello@reactjs.academy</a>.
